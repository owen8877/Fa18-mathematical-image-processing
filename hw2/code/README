In `shockfilters.m`, we can choose between $\Delta u$ or $u_NN$. The usage is
```matlab
options.pde_use_normald2 = true; % stands for $u_NN$
options.pde_use_normald2 = false; % stands for $\Delta u$
shockfilters(image_path, T, result_image_path, options)
```

P.S. I suppose I have carried out a bunch of experiments and concluded the
results in the report, so it would be more convenient to have a look at
`/doc/report.pdf`.
