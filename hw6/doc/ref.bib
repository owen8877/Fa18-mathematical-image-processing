abstract = {Abstract. Blind deconvolution of motion blur is hard, but it can be made easier if multiple images are available. This observation, and an algorithm using two differently-blurred images of a scene are the subject of this paper. While this idea is not new, existing methods have so far not delivered very practical results. In practice, the PSFs corresponding to the two given images are estimated and assumed to be close to the latent motion blurs. But in actual fact, these estimated blurs are often far from the truth, for a simple reason: They often share a common, and unidentified PSF that goes unaccounted for. That is, the estimated PSFs are themselves “blurry”. While this can be due to any number of other blur sources including shallow depth of field, out of focus, lens aberrations, diffraction effects, and the like, it is also a mathematical artifact of the ill-posedness of the deconvolution problem. In this paper, instead of estimating the PSFs directly and only once from the observed images, we first generate a rough estimate of the PSFs using a robust multichannel deconvolution algorithm, and then “deconvolve the PSFs” to refine the outputs. Simulated and real data experiments show that this strategy works quite well for motion blurred images, producing state of the art results.},

abstract = {This paper presents a fast deblurring method that produces a deblur- ring result from a single image of moderate size in a few seconds. We accelerate both latent image estimation and kernel estimation in an iterative deblurring process by introducing a novel prediction step and working with image derivatives rather than pixel values. In the prediction step, we use simple image processing techniques to predict strong edges from an estimated latent image, which will be solely used for kernel estimation. With this approach, a compu- tationally efficient Gaussian prior becomes sufficient for deconvo- lution to estimate the latent image, as small deconvolution artifacts can be suppressed in the prediction. For kernel estimation, we for- mulate the optimization function using image derivatives, and ac- celerate the numerical process by reducing the number of Fourier transforms needed for a conjugate gradient method. We also show that the formulation results in a smaller condition number of the nu- merical system than the use of pixel values, which gives faster con- vergence. Experimental results demonstrate that our method runs an order of magnitude faster than previous work, while the deblur- ring quality is comparable. GPU implementation facilitates further speed-up, making our method fast enough for practical use.},

Our work is$\backslash$ninspired by the interesting observation that the dark chan-$\backslash$nnel of blurred images is less sparse. While most image$\backslash$npatches in the clean image contain some dark pixels, these$\backslash$npixels are not dark when averaged with neighboring high-$\backslash$nintensity pixels during the blur process. This change in the$\backslash$nsparsity of the dark channel is an inherent property of the$\backslash$nblur process, which we both prove mathematically and val-$\backslash$nidate using training data. Therefore, enforcing the sparsity$\backslash$nof the dark channel helps blind deblurring on various sce-$\backslash$nnarios, including natural, face, text, and low-illumination$\backslash$nimages. However, sparsity of the dark channel introduces$\backslash$na non-convex non-linear optimization problem. We intro-$\backslash$nduce a linear approximation of the$\backslash$nmin$\backslash$noperator to com-$\backslash$npute the dark channel.

abstract = {Camera shake is a common source of degradation in photographs. Restoring blurred pictures is challenging because both the blur kernel and the sharp image are unknown, which makes this problem severely underconstrained. In this work, we estimate camera shake by analyzing edges in the image, effectively constructing the Radon transform of the kernel. Building upon this result, we describe two algorithms for estimating spatially invariant blur kernels. In the first method, we directly invert the transform, which is computationally efficient since it is not necessary to also estimate the latent sharp image. This approach is well suited for scenes with a diversity of edges, such as man-made environments. In the second method, we incorporate the Radon transform within the MAP estimation framework to jointly estimate the kernel and the image. While more expensive, this algorithm performs well on a broader variety of scenes, even when fewer edges can be observed. Our experiments show that our algorithms achieve comparable results to the state of the art in general and produce superior outputs on man-made scenes and photos degraded by a small kernel.},

The features of motion blur kernel are sharp dependent on the noise. This paper proposes a novel approach to estimate the parameters of motion blur (orientation and extension) from the observed image gradients. The image gradients enhance the periodic patterns of the motion blur kernel in the frequency space. And the proposed normalized Radon transform from the blurred image gradients could estimate the motion blur parameters in noisy image gradients. Compared to previous estimation algorithm, the results are more accurate when it comes to noisy images.},

abstract = {Background: The proliferation of cloud providers and provisioning levels has opened a space for cloud brokerage services. Brokers intermediate between cloud customers and providers to assist the customer in selecting the most suitable cloud service, helping to manage the dimensionality, heterogeneity, and uncertainty associated with cloud services. Objective: This paper identifies and classifies approaches to realise cloud brokerage. By doing so, this paper presents an understanding of the state of the art and a novel taxonomy to characterise cloud brokers. Method: We conducted a systematic literature survey to compile studies related to cloud brokerage and explore how cloud brokers are engineered. We analysed the studies from multiple perspectives, such as motivation, functionality, engineering approach, and evaluation methodology. Results: The survey resulted in a knowledge base of current proposals for realising cloud brokers. The survey identified surprising differences between the studies' implementations, with engineering efforts directed at combinations of market-based solutions, middlewares, toolkits, algorithms, semantic frameworks, and conceptual frameworks. Conclusion: Our comprehensive meta-analysis shows that cloud brokerage is still a formative field. There is no doubt that progress has been achieved in the field but considerable challenges remain to be addressed. This survey identifies such challenges and directions for future research.},

abstract = {Images are nowadays an integral part of our lives, whether in scientific applications or social networking and where there is an image, the concept of blurring might occur. Blurring is a major cause of image degradation and decreases the quality of an image. Blur occur due to the atmospheric commotion as well as the improper setting of a camera. Along with blur effects, noise also corrupts the captured image. Deblurring is the process of removing blurs and restoring the high-quality latent image. Blur can be various types like Motion blur, Gaussian blur, Average blur, Defocus blur etc. There are many methods present in literature, and we examine different methods and technologies with their advantages and disadvantages.},

abstract = {Human faces are one interesting object class with numerous applications. While significant progress has been made in the generic deblurring problem, existing methods are less effective for blurry face images. The success of the state-of-the-art image deblurring algorithms stems mainly from implicit or explicit restoration of salient edges for kernel estimation. However, existing methods are less effective as only few edges can be restored from blurry face images for kernel estimation. In this paper, we address the problem of deblurring face images by exploiting facial structures. We propose a deblurring algorithm based on an exemplar dataset without using coarse-to-fine strategies or heuristic edge selections. In addition, we develop a convolutional neural network to restore sharp edges from blurry images for deblurring. Extensive experiments against the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for deblurring face images. In addition, we show the proposed algorithms can be applied to image deblurring for other object classes.},

abstract = {The task of image deblurring is a very ill-posed problem as both the image and the blur are unknown. Moreover, when pictures are taken in the wild, this task becomes even more challenging due to the blur varying spatially and the occlusions between the object. Due to the complexity of the general image model we propose a novel convolutional network architecture which directly generates the sharp image.This network is built in three stages, and exploits the benefits of pyramid schemes often used in blind deconvolution. One of the main difficulties in training such a network is to design a suitable dataset. While useful data can be obtained by synthetically blurring a collection of images, more realistic data must be collected in the wild. To obtain such data we use a high frame rate video camera and keep one frame as the sharp image and frame average as the corresponding blurred image. We show that this realistic dataset is key in achieving state-of-the-art performance and dealing with occlusions.},
